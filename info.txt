What is gradient descent:
	Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm which is commonly-used to train machine learning models and neural networks. Training 	data helps these models learn over time, and the cost function within gradient descent specifically acts as a barometer, gauging its 	accuracy with each iteration of parameter updates.
 What is gradient descent?
 	A cost function is an important parameter that determines how well a machine learning model performs for a given dataset. It 		calculates the difference between the expected value and predicted value and represents it as a single real number
What is Neural Network?
	A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human 		brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered 		structure that resembles the human brain.
